#GPS 1.1 Reflection
## Thomas Graves

1. What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session? Pushing commits to the github website.

2. What concepts were clarified during the GPS? The best practices for commiting. Also, fetching and merging and their difference with pulling.

3. What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? When he graduated from the bootcamp. Also what are the best practices for commit messages. Where he works/what he does now. How to customize the terminal for better readability. 

4. What still confuses you about Git? I think I am not so much of confused as I just need to work with it more to become more comfortable with it. Most of the commands make sense to me or at least all of them that I have used so far. 

5. How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS? I had a great time. I feel like it was a great learning experience. For the most part in the initial part of phase 0 you do everything on your own. It was nice to have someone there to confer with and do some problem solving together.
