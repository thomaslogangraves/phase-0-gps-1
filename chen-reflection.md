* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I had issues with fetch and merge because I didn't quite have enough practice doing it before the session.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Our guide clarified best practices for commit messages as well as the commands for 'fetch' and 'merge', when it should be used and how the git pull command is a combination of both.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
When did you graduate from Dev Bootcamp?
What does he do now?
Best practices for commit messages
Themes for terminal to have better color 

* What still confuses you about Git?
I think I mostly just need the practice. I understand the commands, but I sometimes get confused about which to use. 

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was interesting. I started off pretty nervous because the content was fairly new to me and I didn't have a chance to do the assignment. It wasn't as harrowing as I thought it would be. It was also very nice having an experienced person in the background giving feedback when we hit a snag.
